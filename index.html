          Hi I’m Victoria. I’m 45 and from Derby. I’ve been self-employed for 10 years, running my own coffee shop and bakery. I enjoy cooking, reading, socialising with friends, and I love puzzles, in particular Sudoku, I was a finalist in The Times Sudoku championship
          last year. The school of code bootcamp came at the perfect time, I’d decided I wanted a radical career change and was learning to code when this amazing opportunity came up. I’m thrilled to have made it through the selection process and looking
          forward to learning new skills and being ready to start a new career.

          I chose the school of code bootcamp because it was an amazing opportunity to learn code in a supportive and engaging environment. I believe it will equip me with the knowledge and wider skills needed to be successful in the tech industry. I decided to
          pursue code now as I had progressed as far as I wanted to in my previous career and was looking for change. I know the tech industry is fast growing and ever changing, offering plenty of opportunities to challenge myself and grow. Before applying
          to the course I started to learn Python, a language which first got me excited about the possibility of a career in the field. With working in the retail sector for 10 years moving from a sales assistant to a assistant manager I feel has given
          me good people skills that I can transfer to the tech industry.

          Born in 1981, I have always had an interest in Computing, and also computer programming. Going back to as early as about 4 or 5, My parents purchased me my first computer - the ZX Spectrum 48k. I loved this, as me and my father put together the kit and
          he explained to me which bits did what. I was astounded by the complexities of what this marvelous machine could do and I quickly began to learn ZX Basic Programming - writing small games and applications on the Spectrum which was a fascinating
          concept to me. I could make things that were not only fun to write, but fun for others to use. By the age of 10 I had written a few small games and stored them on what was then the best storage going - a magnetic tape! Being given the spectrum
          was the first of many steps towards becoming permanently fascinated with computing. At the age of 13 I was given the next computer I ever owned. The Amiga 1200. The step up from the spectrum was awesome! (this was in 1993). I loved this huge
          upgrade - and it gave me the opportunity to extend further my programming skills at an early age. I don't even begin to pretend that this was the best programming ever, but the idea that what i write in text form made things happen on the Computer
          was amazing! At the age of 16 I left school, and began a summer internship in the Information Technology Department of the NatWest bank PLC. I found a whole new world open up to me of computing - the Windows Based PC - this was amazing! i had
          obviously used Windows PC's before this, but this was the first time i could actually do anything constructive with them beyond word processing and other things. I was involved in assisting with the Roll Out of Windows NT for the bank, and learned
          about computer networking here. this again increased my interest in computers. I left there to go on to Cannock Chase Technical College to study a BTEC National Diploma in Computer Studies. I finished this with a distinction 2 years after starting.
          During that course I learned the principles of computer programming which was the most fascinating subject for me in that course. On the course I learned five languages: X86 Assembly Language, Pascal, Delphi, C++ and Visual Basic. I also learned
          what was then HTML. It was amazing to be able to apply the principles i was learning to multiple languages. I left with a passion for computing, both hardware management and computer programming. I then went on to set up my own web design and
          network management company. I was able to sustain a self-employed living in both of these fields. The highlight of this time was achieving a large contract with a local council. Unfortunately, due to ill health I had to close down the company
          after 10 years. I took time out to recover from the illness that hit me, but in the time i was out of the industry the industry moved on without me. I found myself unable to get a footing back into the industry until The School Of Code Bootcamp
          became available to me. Beginning in September 2017, for 16 weeks, I was training in MongoDB, Node.js, React, HTML5, CSS3. I have bought my skills up to date again. Alongside this, through Udemy i have learned PHP and MySQL programming, and
          can now work as a full stack developer.
